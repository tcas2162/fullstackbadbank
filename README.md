# fullstackbadbank
 
This project was created for my MIT xPro Professional Certificate In Coding course. It allowed me to practice creating a full stack application from start to finish. It demonstrates how a customer at a bank can sign up/login in, deposit money, withdraw money and shows a total ledger of all transactions by all users. This application was written in React and will include authentication in Firebase in a revision that will be launched in the coming week. This will demonstrate how a user must verify their identity before being granted access to the application. This application is also connected to a MongoDB server to store and persist data, along with a data abstraction layer to unify communication.

To launch this program, download the zip file, open the file in your terminal and run node index.js to start a local server. This program was written under the MIT license.
